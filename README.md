# The-Hostage
Game created for GDW 1

## Team Description and Contributions

### Gameplay and Mechanics:
- Gameplay will be similar to Telltale games except you will not move much due to being
  restrained to a chair and being interrogated by a villain. Player will have to choose one of
  the four options given to them to answer the villain’s each question. The player will enter
  the choice number that they want to take. If the player chooses the right answer, the
  player will gain the respect bar moderately that will favour your situation.
- However, if the player give the wrong answer or something that the villain does not like
  to hear, you will receive a hit and you will lose some health bar permanently. In addition,
  you will lose some of your respect bar as well. The lower your respect bar, the more of a
  beating you get. It acts as a multiplier to your damage received. It is gained / lost
  dependent on your answer to each question. Then you will be asked either same
  question again, or if the interrogator liked your answer, another question.
- The time interval will be time limited as the player will have about 15 or 20 seconds to
  answer each question or else the interrogator will inflict damage to your health bar. Also,
  the player’s main objective is to stall the interrogator for five minutes until the rescues
  arrive.
- Another main objective is to answer 15 questions correctly to win the game. However if
you give too much valuable information, the death may be triggered.
